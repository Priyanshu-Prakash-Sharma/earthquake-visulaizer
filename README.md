A great README.md file is the face of your project. It explains what your project is, how it works, and how others can use it. This is crucial for your company assignment and for your portfolio.

Here is a comprehensive README.md template for your Earthquake Visualizer. You can copy and paste this directly into a file named README.md in the root of your project.

üåç EarthQuake Visualizer
An interactive web application to visualize recent earthquake activity around the world.

üìå Project Overview
This project was built to provide a simple, intuitive way for geography students and enthusiasts to explore real-time seismic patterns. Using data from the USGS, the application plots recent earthquakes on an interactive world map, providing a clear visual representation of global seismic activity.

‚ú® Features
Real-time Data: Fetches the latest earthquake data from the USGS API.

Interactive Map: Utilizes react-leaflet to display an interactive world map.

Continuous World View: The map seamlessly wraps horizontally, allowing for an endless view of the globe.

Visual Magnitude Indicators: Earthquake markers are colored and sized according to their magnitude, making it easy to identify the most significant events at a glance.

Detailed Popups: Clicking on a marker reveals a popup with detailed information about the earthquake, including magnitude, location, and time.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
